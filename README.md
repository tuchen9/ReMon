# Website Owner Identification through Multi-level Contrastive Representation Learning

## Introduction
ReMon is a novel framework for website owner identification that formulates the task as webpage representation learning. It leverages LLM-based text rewriting to reduce noise and multi-level contrastive learning to capture websiteâ€“owner relations. ReMon achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets, especially in challenging scenarios where WHOIS records are incomplete or webpages do not explicitly reveal owner names.
